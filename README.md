# ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¼ Malawi Districts Graph Visualization

**This project visualizes connections between Malawi's districts using a force-directed graph layout algorithm.** The output is an optimized layout that clearly shows how districts are connected, minimizing overlaps and improving readability.

---

## ðŸ“¸ Preview

**The layout is rendered using an HTML5 **``** element, showcasing districts as nodes and their connections as edges.**

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html        # Web page with a canvas to render the graph
â”œâ”€â”€ malawiGraph.js    # Force-directed layout algorithm + visualization logic
â””â”€â”€ README.md         # You're here
```
