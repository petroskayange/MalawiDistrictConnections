ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¼ Malawi Districts Graph Visualization

This project visualizes connections between Malawi's districts using a force-directed graph layout algorithm. The output is an optimized layout that clearly shows how districts are connected, minimizing overlaps and improving readability.

ðŸ“¸ Preview

The layout is rendered using an HTML5 <canvas> element, showcasing districts as nodes and their connections as edges.

ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

.
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html          # Web page with a canvas to render the graph
â”œâ”€â”€ malawiGraph.js      # Force-directed layout algorithm + visualization logic
â””â”€â”€ README.md           

ðŸš€ How to Run

Clone this repository

git clone https://github.com/petroskayange/MalawiDistrictConnections
cd MalawiDistrictConnections

Open the Visualization

Simply open index.html in any modern browser (e.g. Chrome, Firefox, Edge):

You can double-click index.html, or

From the terminal:

open index.html        # macOS
xdg-open index.html    # Linux
start index.html       # Windows

See the Output

The canvas will render the districts as black nodes with labeled names, and the edges (connections) will appear as light gray lines.

OR run 
node malawiGraph.js

ðŸ§  How It Works

malawiGraph.js contains:

Raw district data (nodes and edges)

A force-directed layout algorithm that repositions nodes by simulating repulsive and attractive forces

Code to draw the final graph onto the canvas

Coordinates are normalized (between 0 and 1) and scaled to fit the canvas.

ðŸ”§ Customize

You can modify:

iterations, k, and temp values in the forceDirectedLayout() function to change the simulation behavior.
